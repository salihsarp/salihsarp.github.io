## Dissertation

Truck-trailer classification using side-fire LIDAR data

## Ongoing Projects:

### 2018

**_Project :_** Analyzing LIDAR data in precipitation conditions

##  Completed Projects:

### 2018

**_Project :_** Classification of Truck Trailers Based on Side-Fire LIDAR Data

* A custom algorithm has been developed to extract and analyze LIDAR cloud point data
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm has been used
* A heuristic model developed to distinguish refrigerated trailers from non-refrigerated trailers from cloud point data

### 2017
**_Project :_** Evaluation Of Strategies To Reduce Truck Turnarounds At The Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel (HRBT)

  * Analysis of past overheight violations
  * Conduct a survey with truck drivers stopped for overheight violations
  * Deploy a scanner to measure truck profiles and analyze data
  * Analyze the potential impacts of the new OH system on traffic operations  

### 2016

**_Project 1:_** Real-Time System State Prediction & Optimal Rebalancing Strategies for Public Bike Sharing Systems
  * Developed PostgreSQL and NoSQL database server for collecting real time Twitter, Hotel, Weather, and Bike Data

**_Project 2:_** Estimation Of Free-Flow Speed Distributions In Large Networks From Probe Data

  * Mobile GPS data has been used to estimate free-flow speed of freeways in Hampton Roads Area
  * From a methodological standpoint, the general linear model developed for the estimate FFS as a function of roadway characteristics.

**_Project 3:_** Investigating Relationship between Driving Patterns and Traffic Safety using Smartphones Based Mobile Sensor Data

  * Mobile sensor data has been used to identify unsafe driving patterns and quantified the relationship between these driving patterns and traffic crash incidences
  * Recent advancements in the count modeling literature including Heterogeneous Dispersion (HD) and Generalized Ordered Response (GOR) modeling methods are better suited for analyzing crash frequency data compared to standard Poisson and Negative Binomial (NB) models.


### 2015

**_Project 1:_** Classification Algorithms for Detecting Vehicle Stops from Smartphone Accelerometer Data

  * Machine learning algorithms developed to extract useful traffic information from crowdsourced data
  * Developed algorithm detect stops from large accelerometer data produced by smartphones onboard vehicles in the traffic stream

**_Project 2:_** Combining Different Data Sources to Predict Origin-Destinations and Flow Patterns for Trucks in Large Networks

  * Developing vehicle re-identification algorithms that can integrate travel time information with pavement loop data for matching trucks between two sites
  * Assessing the accuracy of the re-identification algorithms as a function of the reliability of the travel time information


### 2014

**_Project:_** Developing GoGreen Android application for vehicle and driver data collection

  * PostgreSQL database server has been developed for offline data analysis
  * The application can collect data from smartphone inertial sensors and on board diagnosis (OBDII)
