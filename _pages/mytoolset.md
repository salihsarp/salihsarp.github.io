* **Modeling and Simulation**

   Modeling and simulation is a discipline for understanding system states for different levels. Most of the engineering fields using modeling and simulation to understand or evaluate a system. So, as an engineer and researcher I am using at least a mathematical model and simulation for my research. I have taken significant amount of simulation courses to improve my knowledge on different type of simulations.

   Taken Relevant Courses:

   1. Introduction to Modeling and Simulation
   2. Agent Based Simulation
   3. Discrete Simulation
   4. Continuous/Real Time Simulation
   5. Simulation Formalism
   6. Modeling Global Events
   7. Systems Modeling
